## Modifying the client.login method
A friendly reminder to those who wants to setup the bot for themselves. This bot is specifically designed for and hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). Heroku has their own variable configuration which can be access using this line of code:
```
  client.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);
```
![Heroku Var Config](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718085539173105687/740417976737464431/download.png)

The login line is what I use for this bot. It is located at **cd Futaba.js\bot.js**:
```
Line 32) client.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);
```
You can change it to whatever you want depending on how you host your bot. Whether is through a config file or directly within the bot.js index file itself. As long as you know what you're doing, you should be fine.
